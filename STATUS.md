# 1. Execution State

## Current Milestone

`R0 — Rendering Correctness`

## Current Task

`R0.7 — Missing Material Tables`

## Task Status

`IN_PROGRESS`

Continuing R0.7. RE-058 found a third pairing shape (`EFDesc`, fighter
entrance effects) alongside `FTCommonPart`/`MPGroundDesc`; RE-059 confirmed
two concrete instances and hand-paired them, fixing 2 of file 353's 3
unpaired graphs (`romtool textures --file 353`: 1 failure → 0;
archive-wide: 617→618 packed, `MissingPalette` 4→3). Code change:
`tools/romtool/src/main.rs`'s `load_all` now inserts `(353, 0x3F8, 0x130)`
and `(353, 0x7B8, 0x4F0)` via `PartTables::insert()`, the same escape hatch
already used for stage layers, since `EFDesc` instances live in the game's
static executable and are structurally invisible to any archive-relocation
scan.

Still open: file 353's third graph (`SpinAttackDObjDesc @ 0x11C0`) is named
by a `WPAttributes` (RE-058) whose instance is not yet typed in the
decompilation, so its `p_mobjsubs` field can't be confirmed non-null before
inserting a pairing for it. Files 52 (`MVCommon`) and 86 (`ITCommonObject`)
are untouched by any of this — nothing found so far suggests they're
`EFDesc`- or `WPAttributes`-shaped; they need their own tracing from
scratch. Next step: trace 52/86, since the `EFDesc` and `WPAttributes`
leads are now exhausted for what they can offer without deeper work
(reading raw bytes to type the `WPAttributes` instance, or determining
whether 52/86 ever had a pairing record to find at all).

## Last Completed Task

R0.7 fixed 2 of file 353's 3 unpaired graphs this session (RE-058 discovers
`EFDesc`, RE-059 confirms and implements it). `R0.3 — Texture Conversion
Completeness` closed earlier this session; both of its failure classes were
root-caused and reattributed to the tasks that actually own a fix:

* 26 segment-0x01 entries → RE-055 → confirmed as `sLBTransitionPhotoHeap`,
  a runtime framebuffer photocopy bound to RSP segment 1, never present in
  any ROM file (`refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/lb/lbtransition.c`) → R0.13's scope
* 4 (now 3) `MissingPalette` entries → RE-057 (via a temporary instrumented
  trace of `crates/ssb-rom/src/mesh.rs`, reverted, not committed) →
  confirmed as a `PartTables` material-pairing gap in 3 specific files, not
  a texture/TLUT decode bug → R0.7's scope (RE-056's dedup-key theory was a
  real secondary factor but not the root cause; RE-057 corrects it) → 1 of
  the 3 files now fixed (RE-059)

RE-054's S2DEX-BG lead (from a prior session) is refuted:
`romtool scan --exhaustive` finds zero `G_BG_1CYC`/`G_BG_COPY` anywhere in
the ROM. See `PLAN.md` R0.3, R0.7 and R0.13.

`R0.2 — N64 Rendering Command Inventory`, `R0.1 — Rendering State
Reconciliation` and `R0.9 — Stage Animation` are also `COMPLETE` — see
`PLAN.md` for each.

## Next Eligible Task

`R0.7` (in progress, see above). `R0.4`'s two remaining open items are
adjacent — one (`all missing palette cases resolved`) is the same RE-057
finding pointing back to R0.7, the other (palette inheritance/state) is
genuinely distinct and tracked toward R0.15. `R0.8` is also eligible
(dependencies R0.1/R0.2 complete, has a lead from RE-054: find the real
matrix-building function for `0x8000`/`RecalcRotRpyRSca` nodes in
`objdisplay.c`) if R0.7's Link trace stalls.

## Blockers

None currently recorded.

# 3. Rendering Gate

Rendering is currently the highest-priority development area.

Combat is intentionally blocked.

Do not begin attacks, hitboxes, damage, knockback, KO, stocks, CPU combat or match gameplay until the rendering milestones explicitly unlock combat.

Movement, physics, collision and animation may continue when required for rendering validation.

---

# 4. Verified Foundation

The following foundation work has been completed:

* ROM validation
* VPK0 decompression
* relocData archive handling
* asset extraction
* runtime asset-pack generation
* F3DEX2 display-list parsing
* N64 texture decoding
* mesh conversion
* scene graph conversion
* fighter animation extraction
* stage animation extraction
* collision extraction
* PSP asset loading
* PSP mesh drawing
* core engine traits
* fixed timestep

# 6. Current Task State

## R0.7 — Missing Material Tables

Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

### Objective

Resolve every scene graph containing an unresolved material table.

### Required Work

* [x] Determine whether file 353 (`LinkSpecial2`)'s graph is rejected by `PartTables::scan`'s same-file requirement despite a real same-file record existing — no: 353 already declares its own graph and its own `MObjSub` table in the same file, so the same-file requirement isn't the blocker (RE-058, retracts RE-057's guess)
* [x] Identify further pairing-record shapes `PartTables` might be missing — found two: `WPAttributes` (weapon/projectile, RE-058) and `EFDesc` (fighter entrance effects, RE-059), both same pointer adjacency as `FTCommonPart` but never documented/verified against `PartTables::scan`
* [x] Fix what `EFDesc` explains — confirmed 2 non-null instances (file 353's `EntryWave`/`EntryBeam`), hand-inserted via `PartTables::insert()` in `tools/romtool/src/main.rs`'s `load_all` (RE-059); verified 0 chain/demand mismatches and `romtool textures --file 353` 1→0 failures
* [ ] Find file 353's own `WPAttributes` instance (names `SpinAttackDObjDesc @ 0x11C0`) and read its `p_mobjsubs` field — not yet typed in the decompilation (still raw bytes in `225_LinkMain.c`), so this needs either waiting on upstream decomp progress or reading the raw ROM bytes directly at the `WPAttributes` struct's known field layout (`data`, `p_mobjsubs`, `anim_joints`, `p_matanim_joints`) to confirm non-null before inserting a pairing
* [x] Check whether `PartTables::scan`'s existing generic matching already structurally catches other `WPAttributes`/`EFDesc` instances archive-wide beyond the ones already found — re-ran `romtool mobj` (whole archive): 58 paired / 69 unpaired, exactly 71-2, confirming no other archive-scannable instance of either shape was silently sitting there; both figures were already accurate, just stale
* [ ] Trace files 52 (`MVCommon`) and 86 (`ITCommonObject`) from scratch — nothing found so far (`FTCommonPart`, `MPGroundDesc`, `WPAttributes`, `EFDesc`) explains them; confirm whether they ever had a pairing record to find, or are legitimately table-less (non-fighter/non-stage UI containers)

### Completion Evidence

Record:

* which files were traced, and what `PartTables::scan` actually found or rejected for each
* the fix implemented (new struct shape wired in via `PartTables::insert()`, newly discovered record, or accepted deviation) with its measured effect on resolved-graph and packed-texture counts — done for file 353's `EntryWave`/`EntryBeam` (RE-059): 56→58 pairings, 617→618 packed textures, `MissingPalette` 4→3
* before/after `romtool mobj`/`romtool scene`/`romtool textures` output — captured for file 353 (RE-059); not yet for 52/86 or the remaining `SpinAttack` graph
* regression test added — none in `cargo test` (the fix lives in `romtool`, a CLI tool, not the library crate; the project's regression pattern for ROM-dependent fixes is a `romtool` command's own output, matching R0.9's stage-animation replay-and-compare check). `romtool mobj --file 353`'s chain/demand-mismatch count is that regression detector here.

---

# 7. Last Verification

## 2026-09-03 — R0.7: EFDesc found and fixed for file 353 (RE-059)

* Ran `romtool mobj --file 353` before any change — confirmed 3 unpaired graphs (0x3F8, 0x7B8, 0x11C0), each "calls the graphics heap but no record names"
* Traced `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/ft/ftcommon/ftcommonentry.c:214-215` → `efManagerLinkEntryWaveMakeEffect`/`efManagerLinkEntryBeamMakeEffect` → `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/ef/efmanager.c:1162-1219`'s `dEFManagerLinkEntryWaveEffectDesc`/`dEFManagerLinkEntryBeamEffectDesc` — found `EFDesc` (`refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/ef/eftypes.h:11-24`), a third pairing shape, with confirmed non-null `DObjDesc*`/`MObjSub***` pointers into file 353 (`EntryWaveDObjDesc @ 0x3F8`/`EntryWaveMObjSub @ 0x130`, `EntryBeamDObjDesc @ 0x7B8`/`EntryBeamMObjSub @ 0x4F0`, cross-checked against `353_LinkSpecial2.c`'s own offset comments)
* Confirmed `EFDesc` instances live in the game's static executable (fixed RAM addresses in `efmanager.c`, not relocData offsets), so `PartTables::scan`'s archive-relocation-only scan can structurally never find them
* Implemented: `tools/romtool/src/main.rs`'s `load_all` now hand-inserts `(353, 0x3F8, 0x130)` and `(353, 0x7B8, 0x4F0)` via `PartTables::insert()`, gated on `read_table` parsing (same pattern as the existing stage-layer inserts)
* `cargo build --release -p romtool` — clean
* `romtool mobj --file 353` after — pairings 56→58, 2 graphs now paired, 0 chain/demand mismatches for both
* `romtool textures --file 353` after — 1 failure → 0
* `romtool textures` (archive-wide) after — 617→618 packed, `MissingPalette` 4→3
* `romtool mobj` (archive-wide, no `--file`) after — 58 paired / 69 unpaired, exactly 71-2, confirming no other archive-scannable `WPAttributes`/`EFDesc` instance was already being silently caught and that both the old 56/71 figures were accurate, just stale
* `cargo test --workspace` — 338 passing, unaffected (fix is in `romtool`, not the library crate)
* Traced SpinAttack's pairing mechanism too: `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/wp/wplink/wplinkspinattack.c`'s `dWPLinkSpinAttackWeaponDesc` names `&llLinkMainSpinAttackWeaponAttributes` (in file 225) as a `WPAttributes`, but unlike the boomerang's, this instance is not yet typed in the decompilation — deliberately left unfixed rather than guessing a table offset
* Result: RE-059 recorded in `docs/reverse-engineering.md`; `PLAN.md` R0.3/R0.4/R0.7, `TODO.md` Phase B/E, `docs/rendering.md`, `docs/porting-status.md` updated to match
* Affected subsystem: `tools/romtool/src/main.rs` (`load_all`) — code change, plus documentation
* PPSSPP: not run this pass
* Physical PSP: not tested this pass — see §8 below

## 2026-09-02 — R0.7 started: WPAttributes found, 353 sibling-file guess retracted

* Read `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/relocData/353_LinkSpecial2.c` directly — found `dLinkSpecial2_EntryWaveDObjDesc`/`dLinkSpecial2_EntryBeamDObjDesc` (graphs) and `dLinkSpecial2_EntryWaveMObjSub`/`dLinkSpecial2_EntryBeamMObjSub` (tables) both defined in the same file, refuting RE-057's "table lives in a sibling file" guess
* Read `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/relocData/225_LinkMain.c`'s `FTCommonPartContainer` — confirmed it pairs Link's *main* model (`dLinkModel_JointTree`, both halves in file 324) and has nothing to do with 353's sub-models
* Read `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/wp/wptypes.h:36-45` — found `WPAttributes`, a second struct with the same `DObjDesc*`/`MObjSub***` adjacency `PartTables::scan` looks for, used for weapon/projectile objects, never documented in `crates/ssb-rom/src/mobj.rs`
* Read `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/relocData/226_LinkSpecial1.c`'s `dLinkSpecial1_Boomerang_WeaponAttributes` — a real `WPAttributes` instance with `p_mobjsubs = NULL` by design (its `data`/`anim_joints` point into file 325, not 353) — shows a null table can be intentional, tempering how much weight to put on "found the missing struct shape" as a guaranteed fix for 353
* Result: RE-058 recorded in `docs/reverse-engineering.md`, retracting RE-057's specific 353 guess while keeping its zero/partial-`mobjs` mechanism finding intact; `PLAN.md` R0.7, `TODO.md` Phase E updated
* Affected subsystem: documentation/investigation only, no code changed
* PPSSPP: not run this pass
* Physical PSP: not tested this pass — see §8 below

## 2026-09-02 — R0.3 closed: segment-0x01 and MissingPalette investigations

* `cargo run --release -p romtool -- scan "rom/Super Smash Bros. (USA).z64" --exhaustive` — 0 occurrences of opcode 0x09/0x0A anywhere in the ROM's display lists; refutes RE-054's S2DEX BG lead
* `cargo run --release -p romtool -- dump "rom/Super Smash Bros. (USA).z64" 39` (and 40/41/45/50/51) — dumped raw file bytes, located the failing `G_SETTIMG` (file 39 offset 0x0E10: `fd10012b 01000000`), confirmed identical bytes recur across files 40/41/45/50/51
* Cross-checked address `0x01000000` (segment 1) against `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/lb/lbtransition.c` — `gSPSegment(..., 0x1, sLBTransitionPhotoHeap)`, a per-frame `300x220` 16-bit framebuffer photocopy for the loading-break transition system; texture dims from `romtool textures --file 39` (`300x5`, `300x6` `Rgba/Bits16`) match
* Temporarily instrumented `crates/ssb-rom/src/mesh.rs` with `eprintln!`s (in `convert_sequence`, the segment-0x0E `Call` handler, `SetTimg`, `LoadTlut`), ran `romtool textures --file 52/86/353`, then reverted the instrumentation (`git checkout -- crates/ssb-rom/src/mesh.rs`) — confirmed files 52 and 353 get zero `MObj` materials for every graph node, file 86 gets them for most but not all nodes; every unresolved segment-0x0E call clears an otherwise-valid palette via `forget_texture()`
* Identified file names via `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/relocData/`: 52=`MVCommon`, 86=`ITCommonObject`, 353=`LinkSpecial2` (one of Link's own model files, unlike 52/86)
* Result: RE-057 recorded in `docs/reverse-engineering.md`, correcting RE-056's dedup-key theory. `PLAN.md` R0.3 marked `COMPLETE`; R0.4, R0.7 updated; `TODO.md` Phase B/E, `docs/rendering.md`, `docs/porting-status.md` updated to match
* Affected subsystem: documentation/investigation only — `crates/ssb-rom/src/mesh.rs` was temporarily modified for tracing and fully reverted before commit; `git diff` confirms no net code change
* PPSSPP: not run this pass
* Physical PSP: not tested this pass — see §8 below
* Result: RE-055 and RE-056 recorded in `docs/reverse-engineering.md`; `PLAN.md` R0.3/R0.13, `TODO.md` Phase B, `docs/rendering.md`, `docs/porting-status.md` updated to match
* Affected subsystem: documentation/investigation only, no code changed
* PPSSPP: not run this pass
* Physical PSP: not tested this pass — see §8 below

## 2026-09-02 — R0.2 BattleShip cross-reference

* Cloned `refs/BattleShip` + `libultraship` submodule (`ssb64` branch); read `src/fast/interpreter.cpp`
* Cross-checked against `refs/ssb-decomp-re/src/sys/objdisplay.c` (already present, no clone needed)
* Result: RE-054 recorded in `docs/reverse-engineering.md`; three new leads filed in `TODO.md` (R0.13 S2DEX BG, R0.5 LOD corroboration, R0.8 transform clarification)
* Affected subsystem: documentation/investigation only, no code changed
* PPSSPP: not run this pass
* Physical PSP: not tested this pass — see §8 below

## 2026-09-02 — Documentation audit (R0.1)

* `cargo test --workspace` — 338 passing (`ssb-rom` 195, `ssb-engine` 36, `ssb-game` 107), 0 failed
* `cargo run --release -p romtool -- textures "rom/Super Smash Bros. (USA).z64"` — 647 bound / 617 packed / 30 failed (26 segment-0x01, 4 `MissingPalette`); matches what `docs/rendering.md` now documents
* Affected subsystem: documentation only, no code changed
* PPSSPP: not re-run this pass; prior baseline stands (see `docs/porting-status.md` "M1 verification")
* Physical PSP: not tested this pass — see §8 below

Future entries must include:

* command/test;
* result;
* relevant output;
* affected subsystem;
* whether PPSSPP was tested;
* whether physical PSP was tested.

# 8. Physical PSP Validation

## Status

`R2 ACCEPTANCE NOT YET PERFORMED`

The project has been booted and smoke-tested on physical PSP hardware earlier
in development. That testing was not captured against `PLAN.md` R2's
acceptance criteria (hardware model, build, asset-pack version, per-feature
observed behavior, VRAM usage) and predates the rendering work tracked under
R0, so it does not stand in for R2. Treat R2 as not started until a hardware
session records the fields below.

PPSSPP testing does not count as physical PSP validation.

When R2 hardware validation begins, record:

* PSP model
* firmware/environment
* EBOOT/build
* runtime asset pack
* test scene
* observed FPS/frame time
* VRAM behavior
* rendering failures
* screenshots/video where useful

---

# 9. Important Rules

* `PLAN.md` determines task order.
* `STATUS.md` determines current execution state.
* `docs/porting-status.md` determines verified subsystem status.
* `AGENTS.md` determines agent behavior.
* Rendering is the hard gate.
* Do not begin combat because rendering appears "good enough".
* Do not mark work complete without evidence.
* Do not treat PPSSPP as physical PSP validation.
* Do not invent original N64 behavior when the decompilation/ROM can answer it.
