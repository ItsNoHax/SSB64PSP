# Encode a WAV into SND0.AT3, the PSP's XMB background music (docs/xmb-assets.md).

#
# ATRAC3 is Sony's codec and nothing packages an encoder for it: ffmpeg knows the format but
# ships decoders only, and the `ffmpeg -c:a atrac3` line that circulates in PSP guides fails with
# "no encoders for it are available". So this builds atracdenc, and libsndfile for it to read WAV
# with, into a scratch directory. Nothing is installed system-wide.
#
# The output is committed, so this only needs running if the source loop changes.
#
# Usage: tools/encode-snd0.sh SOURCE.wav OUTPUT.AT3 [work-dir]

# RIFF is the container a PSP SND0.AT3 uses; `oma` and `rm` will not play in the XMB.
#
# LP4 (66 kbps), not LP2. The XMB would not play a 132 kbps file at all: every working SND0 on a
# real memory stick is 66144 bps with a block align of 192 and the joint-stereo flag set, and an
# LP2 file differs in all three. Verified by extracting SND0 from games whose music does play and
# diffing the format chunk.
#
# The mode is `atrac3_lp4`. atracdenc's own help calls it `atrac3_lp`, which the binary rejects.
#
# The source is low-passed first. The top QMF band starts at 44100/8*3 = 16537 Hz and the patch
# above stops it being coded at all, so anything up there would simply be discarded — better to
# filter it cleanly than to let the encoder spend bits on it.

# either claim fewer samples than they carry (Mario 64 claims seven frames fewer) or omit the
# chunk entirely (MasterBoy). The chunk is optional, and the file that omits it is known to play
# on the target hardware, so match that rather than guess at a correct count.
